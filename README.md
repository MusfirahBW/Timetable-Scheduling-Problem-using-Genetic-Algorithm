# Timetable-Scheduling-Problem-using-Genetic-Algorithm

Timetable scheduling problem is a classical problem in the university environment where a timetable is to be made individually for each semester ensuring minimum number of clashes between sections, professors, and rooms. Thus, we have a timetabling problem where time slots are assigned to each section in a particular room to be taught by a particular professor to teach a particular course. Please note that each week, there are 2 classes per theory course (each of 1 hour 20 mins length), and lab courses will have a single long session of 3 hours.

All the other hard and soft constraints are mentioned in the project documentation.
